## Training for construction of polygenic risk score using PRSice2
In different sources, the terms ‘polygenic score (PGS)’, ‘polygenic risk scores (PRS)’, and ‘genetic risk score (GRS)’ are used interchangeably. All refer to the same score where “[multi-locus profiles of genetic risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23701538/), so-called genetic risk scores, can be used to translate discoveries from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into tools for population health research” . Evident from the explanation, construction of a PRS is dependent on findings from GWAS.

This [weblink](https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores) gives a very nice overview of PRS for readers who might need an update on their understanding of genetic variations and disease development and how complex diseases are different from single-gene (Mendelian) diseases. 

The tutorial uses publicly available datasets from [1000 Genomes phase 3 release](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/phase-3).<br/>
We use mostly unrelated individuals, and use SNPs in common with HapMap3 and UK Biobank. This dataset is provided by Florian Privé and is available [online](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/1000_genomes_phase_3_files_with_SNPs_in_common_with_HapMap3/9208979)
