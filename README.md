## Training for construction of polygenic risk score using PRSice2
The tutorial uses publicly available datasets from [1000 Genomes phase 3 release](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/phase-3).<br/>
We use mostly unrelated individuals, and use SNPs in common with HapMap3 and UK Biobank. This dataset is provided by Florian Priv√© and is available [online](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/1000_genomes_phase_3_files_with_SNPs_in_common_with_HapMap3/9208979)
